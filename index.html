            <p>As a Research Development Officer, I provide direction to researchers to ensure their funding applications adhere to funder guidelines and perform due diligence on potential projects. I liaise with academics, the costings team, and senior team members to ensure deadlines are met. To enhance strategic funding acquisition, I completed training with Hyperion on 'Identifying Opportunities in Horizon Europe.' I am currently collaborating with a Senior Research Development Manager on a £3 million funding application.</p>

        <h2>EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS</h2>
        <div class="education">
            <h3>Lancaster University: PhD Candidate (2017-2022)</h3>
            <p>As a graduate researcher, sponsored by an environmental consultancy, Phlorum Ltd, and the Centre for Global Eco-Innovation, I explored the capacity for a combined mid-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics approach with the aim to overcome the recalcitrant nature of Japanese knotweed. Additionally, I supported undergraduate practical sessions as a demonstrator, encouraging undergraduate recruitment, and leading the organisation of an outreach event. Calculated carbon emissions for industry sponsor. Awarded Associate Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy. Successfully applied for extra grant funding from NERC and for licenses from DEFRA for the growth of plant species on the Invasive Alien Species of Union Concern list, as well as writing SOPs and COSHH forms for my own laboratory work.</p>
            <p>Maintained motivation during independent working through self-set deadlines and seeking guidance where appropriate. Successfully applied for external funding from NERC for my PhD research, and to support the Pint of Science Festival. Persisted with challenging experiments and set deadlines to start an alternative path if sufficient progress was not made with ‘Plan A’.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="education">
            <h3>Durham University: Natural Sciences Masters with Dual Honours Biology and Chemistry (2012-2016)</h3>
            <p>My master’s project was part of an established research group of several academics and students from across Chemistry, Physics and Biosciences, and a company, High Force Research Ltd. The focus was ‘fluorescent synthetic retinoids’ which were synthesised as part of a Chemistry PhD student’s project. The aim of my project was to understand these compounds’ potential for use as probes and confirm comparable action to the endogenous compound ATRA in vitro, using qPCR and fluorescent microscopy. In doing so, I discovered that at certain wavelengths of light the compounds triggered extremely targeted cell death. This technology was further developed after my research and has resulted in a spin-off company called Light-Ox, which gave me an early insight into the importance of IP to research. I found this an exciting collaborative project with lots of people with which to exchange ideas. Other fourth year modules included bio-molecular analysis, bioactive chemistry, and research skills. Official university result: Upper Second-Class Honours.</p>
